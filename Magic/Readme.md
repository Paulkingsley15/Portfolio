# Magic Data Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes a dataset collected from the MAGIC gamma telescope. The goal is to predict whether a particular event is classified as a gamma ray or a hadron, using various features derived from the telescope's measurements. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning modeling to build and evaluate classifiers.

## Project Overview
The MAGIC gamma telescope dataset contains measurements from high-energy cosmic ray observations. The primary objective is to distinguish between gamma rays and hadrons using features related to object size, shape, and orientation. The project implements machine learning techniques to build predictive models that classify each event based on these characteristics.

## Dataset
- **Source**: The dataset is sourced from the MAGIC gamma telescope project.
- **Features**:
  - `FLength`: Major axis length of the object.
  - `FWidth`: Minor axis length of the object.
  - `FSize`: Size of the object.
  - `FConc`: Object concentration.
  - `FConc1`: Concentration at a single pixel.
  - `FAsym`: Asymmetry of the object.
  - `FM3Long`: Third root transformation of the long axis.
  - `FM3Trans`: Third root transformation of the transverse axis.
  - `FAlpha`: Orientation of the object.
  - `FDist`: Distance of the object.
  - `Class`: Classification label (either gamma or hadron).
- **Size**: [Number of records] rows and 11 features (10 features and 1 target).

## Methods
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing or erroneous values (if applicable).
  - Feature scaling and transformation to improve model performance.
  - Encoding the target variable for classification (binary: gamma or hadron).
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizing the distribution of each feature.
  - Identifying correlations between features and the target variable.
  - Analyzing the relationships between object size, shape, and classification.

- **Modeling**:
  - Various machine learning models are used to classify the events, including:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Random Forest
    - Decision Trees
  - The models are evaluated using performance metrics such as:
    - Accuracy
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1-score

## Results
- **Classification Models**: 
  - The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of [X%], with a precision of [Y%] and recall of [Z%].
  - Feature importance analysis shows that the most significant factors in classification are `FLength`, `FSize`, and `FConc`.

## How to Run
1. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Run the Notebook: Open the notebook using Jupyter:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook MagicData.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the cells sequentially.

Data Processing:

The notebook loads the magic04.data file and processes the data, including handling missing values and transforming features for model input.
EDA is performed to visualize the data and understand its structure.
Machine Learning:

Machine learning models are built to predict the classification label (gamma or hadron).
The results of each model are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
