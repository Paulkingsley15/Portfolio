   - **Key Skills**: NLP, Hugging Face transformers, RoBERTa, PyTorch, Sentiment Analysis.
   - **Objective**: To better understand customer feedback and automatically classify reviews based on sentiment.
   - **Outcome**: Successfully built a model that performs well on test data, achieving high accuracy and providing key insights into the most frequent positive and negative words.

### 2. **Fantasy Football Draft Optimization**
   - **Description**: In this fun, data-driven project, I designed a Python tool to optimize fantasy football drafts by evaluating player performance, ranking, and drafting strategies. This project combines data scraping, player statistics analysis, and machine learning to offer optimal drafting recommendations.
   - **Key Skills**: Data Scraping, Pandas, Data Preprocessing, Machine Learning.
   - **Objective**: To assist users in making informed decisions during fantasy football drafts.
   - **Outcome**: Developed a tool that simplifies the decision-making process during drafts, offering player recommendations based on historical performance data.

### 3. **Magic Gamma Telescope Data Classification**
   - **Description**: This project analyzes data from the MAGIC Gamma Telescope to classify whether observations correspond to gamma rays or hadrons. The classification model leverages machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict outcomes based on telescope data.
   - **Key Skills**: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), Scikit-Learn.
   - **Objective**: To classify gamma rays and hadrons using key features from telescope data.
   - **Outcome**: Achieved strong classification performance using machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential for improving astrophysical data analysis.

### 4. **Basketball Shot Analysis**
   - **Description**: This project involves analyzing basketball shot data to predict shot success and understand player performance trends. By utilizing various machine learning models, the project seeks to uncover patterns in shot types, distances, and outcomes, and develop a model that predicts the likelihood of a successful shot.
   - **Key Skills**: Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Pandas, Scikit-Learn.
   - **Objective**: To explore the factors contributing to shot success and to build a model that predicts the outcome of a basketball shot based on available data.
   - **Outcome**: Developed a shot success prediction model that provides insights into shooting efficiency based on player and game conditions, assisting with performance analysis.

### 5. **Bike Sharing Analysis**
   - **Description**: This project involves analyzing a bike-sharing dataset to uncover trends in bike rentals and build predictive models for future demand. The analysis includes time-series breakdowns of bike rentals and the impact of weather, holidays, and working days on the demand for bikes.
   - **Key Skills**: Time-Series Analysis, Regression Modeling, Pandas, Matplotlib.
   - **Objective**: To identify the factors influencing bike rentals and build a model to predict future demand.
